<!--
  The selected code is the index.html file for a React application. This file serves as the main HTML document that is served when someone visits your site. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration helps with browser compatibility.

    The <html lang="en"> tag declares the language of this document to be English.

    The <head> section includes meta information about the webpage:

        The <meta charset="utf-8" /> tag sets the character encoding for the document.
        The <link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" /> tag sets the favicon for the webpage.
        The <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /> tag makes the webpage responsive on different devices.
        The <meta name="theme-color" content="#000000" /> tag sets the theme color for the webpage.
        The <meta name="description" content="Web site created using create-react-app" /> tag sets the description of the webpage.
        The <link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/logo192.png" /> tag sets the web application icon for Apple devices.
        The <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" /> tag points to the web app manifest file, which provides information about the application (such as name, author, icon, and description) in a JSON text file.
        The <title> tag sets the title of the webpage.

    The <body> section is where the content of the webpage goes:

        The <noscript> tag displays a message to users who have JavaScript disabled in their browser.
        The <div id="root"></div> tag is the root DOM node for the React application. React will replace this div with its components.

    The %PUBLIC_URL% placeholder in the HTML file will be replaced with the URL of the public folder during the build process. This allows you to reference assets in the public folder.

    The comments provide additional information about the file and instructions for development and production builds.

      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/
    -->
    <link rel="manifest" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json" />
    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
