/*
The selected code is a simple React functional component named Spinner. This component is typically used to display a loading spinner or indicator while some data is being fetched or some operation is being performed. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

    The Spinner function is a functional component that returns a JSX structure. This structure represents the layout of the spinner.

    Inside the returned JSX, there's a div with a class of 'loadingSpinnerContainer'. This is likely the container for the spinner.

    Inside the 'loadingSpinnerContainer' div, there's another div with a class of 'loadingSpinner'. This is likely the actual spinner. The specific details of how the spinner looks and animates would be defined in the CSS for these classes.

    Finally, the Spinner component is exported as the default export from this module, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

function Spinner() {
  return (
    <div className='loadingSpinnerContainer'>
      <div className='loadingSpinner'></div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Spinner
